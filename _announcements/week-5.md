Unfortunately, last week's lecture got delayed, and has just been posted. 

This lecture was about writing *gas efficient* and *secure* solidity code, elevating your skills past the basic syntax we've covered so far. It's only around 40 minutes long but dense with great information and pointers to resources that you can keep coming back to reference. 

As for Week 6's content, we're working on the lecture and may push it back a bit to accomodate for the lateness of last week's lecture. The assignment may be pushed out to be compeleted over the following week, which is Spring Break and has no lecture. We'll keep you all updated as we go!

Welcome to Week 4! This week we are going over `ethers.js` and how it is used to connect our smart contracts to the web!

The lecture slides and recording is up. The lab will be posted soon - you'll be using scaffold-eth to play around with a React frontend for the NFT Marketplace you made last week.

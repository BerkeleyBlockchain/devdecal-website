Welcome to Week 3! This week we'll continue going over solidity syntax, delving into quirks and features special to Solidity. 

The homework for this week will be your first opportunity to write Solidity code yourself! You'll be writing a NFT Marketplace contract, which will be the contract that you'll be incrementally improving over the course of this semester.

Also, please remember to submit the lecture vitamin after each lecture, to check your understanding and confirm your attendance.

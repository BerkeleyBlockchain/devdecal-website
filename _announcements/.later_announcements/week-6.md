Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 6.

First, we'd like to announce some restructing of the course:

The 'Writing Large Dapps' lecture will be split into two sections: a recorded lecture delivered by Scott Sunarto from last semester that goes into greater depth on contract design and deployment, and a new second lecture delivered by us that more closely follows an assignment that will be released during Spring Break (next week). This assignment will involve writing and deploying a smart contract that integrates with existing, popular smart contracts such as Uniswap or Seaport. Details on this assignment will be released with the lecture next week.

Secondly, we're opening office hours throughout next week to help students catch up with any of the content so far. Feel free to come ask about lecture content, getting started/finished with labs, or anything else. Office hours will be hosted 12-3pm on Wednesday, but you can email us at devdecal (at) berkeley.edu to schedule any alternate time. We're more than happy to schedule alternative times to help you.

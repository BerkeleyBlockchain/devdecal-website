bio: I am a third-year Computer Science major at Berkeley from Bangalore, India, and I have previously taught Blockchain Fundamentals! I have an extensive background in Web3 development, including working for Coinbase as a Software Engineering intern, working as an external developer consultant for Blockchain@Berkeley, and building out projects at hackathons (check out [Lilac](#https://ethglobal.com/showcase/lilac-waeur) - a DAO governance platform we built at ETH New York)! Excited for the semester!

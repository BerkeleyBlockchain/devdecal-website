bio: Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm studying my third year of Computer Science at Berkeley, and have been a member of Blockchain at Berkeley for two years. I'm primary interested in topics around protocol design and scalability, with a deep passion for cypherpunk values and building rights-preserving technology. I've taught this class once before, given guest lectures for Fundamentals, and explored my interests in the space via hackathons and open source contribution. Let's chat!
